Small app that allows you to enable or disable the League of Legends chat to appear in offline mode.
Requires .NET installed

Download ***lolchat.Offline.zip*** and run as administrator.

The only thing the app does is create a firewall rule that blocks the League of Legends chat from connecting to the internet.
